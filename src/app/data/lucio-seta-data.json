        "description": "<p>The <b>SENSING VOLUMES</b> project includes an interactive installation where participants can explore their senses, as well as three one-hour-long performances where a solo dancer engages with the installation and showcases its potential. The installation is designed to translate body movement on stage into sound, as well as sound into real-time lighting and visuals.This helps the audience to experience the performance as a whole, giving multiple pathways for exploring and participating in the work, despite any impairments or preferences across the senses.</p><p>A big textile sculpture made of ropes will be an analog complement to the digital installation and can be moved and transformed by the audience. These elements provide a soft, tactile experience, inviting to take time and observe the overall playground.</p><p>The artists are designing performances, installations and workshops where sound, visual and movement become part of the same vocabulary.</p>",

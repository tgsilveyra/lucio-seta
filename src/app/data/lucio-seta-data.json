        "description": "<p>Who will raise their hand? is an urban dance program that mixes elements of modern dance, hip hop and parcours. The group has its very own style. It mixes urban dance forms with contemporary choreographies and sometimes indigenous rhythms. This allows them to escape the 'ghetto' cliché and create a completely new style. The dance becomes a kind of ritual that creates a bridge of connection and thus transcends differences in origin, skin color, clichés and socialization. It is about mobilizing the community to stand up and declare war on the injustice of the world!</p>",

About the resignifcation of space and the others, who confirm that the space is worth only because we fill it together.</p><p>The plot is immersed in the point of view of the one who left, and does not know when to return. It is a short film that suffers the uprooting beyond the privilege of being able to leave. The guilt of leaving those who grow old elsewhere and the pressure to grow up invade the light of the week, while Manu understands a possible path towards something that is still unknown to him, but familiar. And, thus, he approaches that which moved him in some past time.</p><p>Does it still belong?</p>",

The installation is designed to translate body movement on stage into sound, as well as sound into real-time lighting and visuals.This helps the audience to experience the performance as a whole, giving multiple pathways for exploring and participating in the work, despite any impairments or preferences across the senses.</p><p>A big textile sculpture made of ropes will be an analog complement to the digital installation and can be moved and transformed by the audience. These elements provide a soft, tactile experience, inviting to take time and observe the overall playground.</p><p>The artists are designing performances, installations and workshops where sound, visual and movement become part of the same vocabulary.</p>",
